# Quick Test - Copy & Paste Examples

Want to see the visual enhancements in action? Here are some ready-to-test markdown snippets you can use.

## Option 1: Quick Browser Console Test

Open your app in the browser, open the console, and run:

```javascript
// Add a test message with an image
const testMessage = {
  role: "assistant",
  content: `## Featured Project: Mobile App Design

Here's the final design:

### Key Features
- ✨ Clean, modern interface
- 📱 Mobile-first design
- 🎨 Custom color palette
- ⚡ Fast loading animations

### Impact
- **50%** increase in user engagement
- **3x** higher conversion rate
- **4.8/5** user satisfaction score`
};

// This would add it to your messages array
// You'll need to adapt this to your actual state management
```

## Option 2: Test with Real Case Study Format

Create a test response that mimics what your AI will generate:

```markdown
## Case Study: Optym LMS Search Feature

### 🎯 The Challenge

Drivers needed to quickly find training modules while on the road. The existing search was slow and unintuitive.

### 🔍 Research & Discovery

**User Interviews:** Spoke with 15 truck drivers
**Key Insight:** They search by topic, not module name

### ✨ The Solution

Implemented a smart, hierarchical search system:

**Features:**
- Predictive search suggestions
- Category-based filtering  
- Recent searches quick access
- Voice search capability

### 📈 Results

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Search Time | 45s | 12s | **73% faster** |
| Task Success | 65% | 94% | **29% increase** |
| User Rating | 3.2/5 | 4.7/5 | **47% higher** |

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Figma for design & prototyping
- React & TypeScript for implementation
- User testing with drivers
- Analytics tracking

### 💡 Key Learnings

> "The best search is the one you don't notice. It just works."

This project taught me the importance of:
1. **Deep user research** - Understanding real-world constraints
2. **Iterative testing** - Testing with actual drivers, not designers
3. **Performance matters** - Speed is a feature, not a metric

## How to Use These Tests

### Method A: Backend Response
1. Temporarily modify your backend to return one of these responses
2. Ask any question to trigger it
3. See the visual formatting in action

### Method B: Component State
1. Add a test button that injects these messages
2. Click to see instant results
3. Perfect for rapid testing

### Method C: System Prompt Context
1. Add sample media URLs to your case study documents
2. Let the AI naturally reference them
3. Most realistic test scenario

## Expected Visual Results

When you paste these examples, you should see:

✅ **Images:**
